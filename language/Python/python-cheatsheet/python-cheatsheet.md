1. Avoid abbreviating variable names.
2. Write out your function argument names.
3. Document your classes and methods.
4. Comment your code.
5. Refactor repeated lines of code into reusable functions or methods.
6. Keep functions and methods short. A good rule of thumb is that scrolling

should not be necessary to read an entire function or method.

## TIP: Use Flake8 for Checking Code Quality.
